# Projects and Assignments done during my M.tech degree
Projects and Colab worksheets of Python-programming, Deep learning for Computer-vision, Data-mining, Data-analysis and Advanced optimization techniques are included.

1)Python programming exercises:
    
   - The worksheets contains questions and program solutions related to various python concepts.

2)Advanced optimization technique:
    
   - Implemented the Clonal selection algorithm for the optimization of Eight-Queen problem. 
   - The colab notebook of the same is available.

3)Data analysis:
    
   - Analysis and visualization of diffrent real world dataset of different domains and extract target information from the bulk data for processing or visualization.
   - Folder contains the colab notebooks that were prepared during the Free-code-camp data analysis course.
   - Folder contains the dataset used for the colab notebooks.
 
4)Data mining:
    
   - Contains domonstration of different data mining and data cleaning techniques used on real world datasets like loan-data,diabetic,covid etc

5)Deep-learning with computer-vision:
    
   - Deep learning techniques used for image classification and prediction.
   - Implementation of gradient descent algorithm for 2 variables, which takes function,initial weights as input and outputs the correct updated weights.
   - Demonstration of different types of images and properties.
 
6)Image processing:
    
    -LZ77,LZ78,LZW codings
    -Huffmann , adaptive Huffmann, Shannon-fannno coding
